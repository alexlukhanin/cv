            <p>I am <em><strong>future Java developer</strong></em> from Ukraine currently based in Uzhhorod. Iâ€™ve got extensive
                experience in working with computer hardware such as testing, repairing, building,
                software <a href="https://www.google.com">installation</a> and support, which will give me a best condition for starting as
                programmer. Also, I have <strong>a lot of experience communicating</strong> with clients and colleagues
                and little managerial experience as a service manager.
